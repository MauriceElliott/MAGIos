- **CMake Alternative**: Additional CMake build system for flexibility
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation between kernel logic and interoperability layers

### ✅ Memory Management & Linker Integration
- **Custom Linker Script**: `linker_swift.ld` handles Swift metadata sections and memory layout
- **Direct Hardware Access**: Swift code directly manipulates VGA memory at 0xB8000

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Memory Layout
- **Kernel Base**: 0x00100000 (1MB, standard OS location)
- **VGA Buffer**: 0xB8000 (direct hardware access from Swift)
- **Stack Size**: 16KB shared between C and Swift
- **Binary Size**: ~15KB total (C + Swift + metadata)

### Swift Integration Features
- **Zero-Runtime Overhead**: Embedded mode eliminates ARC and standard library
- **Type Safety**: Swift's type system prevents common kernel programming errors
- **Modern Syntax**: Clean, readable code for complex kernel operations
- **Interoperability**: Seamless calls between C and Swift code

### Build Process
1. **Swift Compilation**: Target i686-unknown-none-elf with embedded features
2. **Object Extraction**: Static library unpacking and relinking
3. **C Compilation**: Traditional cross-compilation with Swift headers
4. **Linking**: Custom linker script combining all components
5. **ISO Creation**: Bootable image with GRUB multiboot support
