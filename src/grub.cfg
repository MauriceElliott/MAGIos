# === GRUB CONFIGURATION NOTES ===
#
# This configuration file is used by GRUB bootloader to boot MAGIos
# It's placed in the ISO at /boot/grub/grub.cfg
#
# MULTIBOOT:
# We use the multiboot command to load our kernel
# This tells GRUB that our kernel follows the Multiboot specification
#
# BOOT ENTRIES:
# 1. Main entry - Standard boot with Evangelion theming
# 2. Diagnostic entry - Future use for diagnostic/debug mode
#
# TIMEOUT:
# 3 seconds gives enough time to select but doesn't delay too long
# Matches the urgency of Eva pilot entry sequences
#
# THEMING:
# Menu entries reference NERV, Evangelion Unit-01, and MAGI system
# Maintains consistent Evangelion aesthetic throughout boot process
