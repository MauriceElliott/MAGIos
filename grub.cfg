# MAGIos GRUB Configuration File
# This file tells GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader) how to boot our operating system

# === TIMEOUT SETTING (Non-critical) ===
# How long to wait before automatically booting the default entry (in seconds)
# Set to 0 for immediate boot, or higher value to give user time to select options
set timeout=3

# === DEFAULT BOOT ENTRY (Non-critical) ===
# Which menu entry to boot by default (0 = first entry, 1 = second entry, etc.)
set default=0

# === MENU ENTRY DEFINITION ===
# This creates a bootable menu option that appears in GRUB
menuentry "MAGIos - Terminal Dogma Access" {
    # === MULTIBOOT COMMAND (CRITICAL) ===
    # This tells GRUB to load our kernel using the Multiboot specification
    # /boot/kernel.bin is the path to our kernel binary within the ISO
    # The multiboot command passes information about the system to our kernel
    multiboot /boot/kernel.bin

    # === BOOT COMMAND (CRITICAL) ===
    # Actually start booting the kernel
    # This transfers control from GRUB to our kernel's entry point
    boot
}

# === ADDITIONAL MENU ENTRIES (Non-critical - for future expansion) ===
# You can add more menu entries here for different boot options
# For example:
# menuentry "MAGIos - Safe Mode" {
#     multiboot /boot/kernel.bin safe_mode
#     boot
# }

# === GRUB TERMINAL SETTINGS (Non-critical - cosmetic) ===
# Set terminal colors to match the Evangelion aesthetic
# Format: set color_normal=foreground/background
set color_normal=cyan/black
set color_highlight=light-red/black

# === BOOT MESSAGE (Non-critical - cosmetic) ===
# This appears before the menu
echo "MAGI System Bootloader"
echo "Initializing Terminal Dogma Access..."
